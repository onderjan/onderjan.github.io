I am a doctoral candidate at the Czech Technical University in Prague, researching formal verification of machine-code systems. I am also interested in processor design and signal processing (both analog and digital), especially in the context of audio. 

**I am currently looking for a postdoc position.** I have already submitted my dissertation thesis and am expecting it to defend it in late 2024 or early 2025. [My Curriculum Vitae is available here.](cv_onderka.pdf)


## Projects
I am the creator of [machine-check](https://crates.io/crates/machine-check), a formal verification tool for digital systems. Intended especially for verification of machine-code programs by writing a processor description. Feasibility of verification is enhanced via Three-valued Abstraction Refinement. I have created a processor description for the AVR ATmega328P microcontroller used in Arduino UNO R3, available as [machine-check-avr](https://crates.io/crates/machine-check-avr).

I also contributed to the [CPAchecker](https://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org/) software verification tool. I added support for the standard C functions `memset`, `memcpy`, and `memmove`, and improved the handling of quantifiers.
